# Tic-Tac-Toe-in-x86-Assembly-Language

This project is a fully functional Tic-Tac-Toe game built using x86 Assembly Language. It allows two players to take turns marking spaces on a 3x3 grid. The game checks for a winner after each move and declares a tie if all spaces are filled without a winner.
